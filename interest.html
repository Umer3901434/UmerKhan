            <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
            <article>I am passionate about how technology is changing and how the world keeps getting better with new things being invented. This can include how they made TVs smart into making homes smart and giving the owner full control with a touch of their finger. My passion started mainly from playing a game that showed me how the world is all technology now which got me interested in knowing all these things that use technology. Which is why I cannot see technology without thinking about how much coding or other things it would require to make it work. I have not found a specific thing that interests me in technology yet but as it looks like everything is interesting to me and worth knowing about.</article>
            
            <article>I chose RMIT to study this degree because I saw many articles and news online talking about how RMIT is making their learning environment different and upgraded to the highest tech there is make me feel maybe this might be the best place to study. Another reason was how RMIT is an institute of technology which instantly made me think about how advanced the university is and how interesting the technology would be in the campus. At this point after seeing only a couple of buildings and the library, I am satisfied with my choice and thankful for having the ability to go here every week. I expect the general knowledge for anyone doing anything related with technology, which is a great start (for me).</article>
