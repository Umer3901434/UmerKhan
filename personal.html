            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <article>The personality test surprises me as I am regarded as a logistician. The most surprising thing was this was the same personality for people like George H.W. Bush or George Washington. I was not surprised about my identity part of the personality, I had high turbulence as I am a type of person who really gets worried in normal or little intense situations. I was also not surprised with my learning style as it is what I am used to. My learning style has been visual as I always take notes or putting pictures in the notes section to remind me. The Big Five Factors Markers were surprising to me as I never thought of myself to be a careful and friendly person.</article>
            <article>In a team I think me being a logistician and a careful thinker will allow for me to help the group in sections. The friendly part may allow me to make some new friends in the group. The only thing going against all I said is how I am a careful thinker or my identity being turbulent as I will be extremely shy as I do not want to be saying something wrong or pointless in a conversation.</article>
            <article>When forming a team, I think I need to start being more confident and stop overthinking in calm situations. Maybe being extra might allow me to help my teammates but making sure we are up to date or think of something team maybe did not. From how I am, I will definitely join conversation often and make sure that I do not only think but also talk about my thoughts.</article>
