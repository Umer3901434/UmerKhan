            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>The IT project I would like to work on would be a home security camera that can be accessed on the phone or laptop livestreaming. This means through an app or laptop link, the camera can be showed live streaming the house areas you find that are most vulnerable or where ever the user needs. This live stream will also be saving all the data to be checked by again. This camera will also be able to detect faces or bodies and send an email to the user for any unwanted guests by taking a picture of motion it detected.</p>
            <p>This will be beneficial for the user as they can check the house’s safety or where the user decides to put the camera as the Raspberry Pi technology can be incased any type of box to look through. This will give families more confidence as buying a kit and asking someone to set up around 4 to cameras in the kit. With this it is portable and easy to put anywhere, allowing for parents to be able to check on their kids inside of the house or putting this device in a place the user finds vulnerable from a drawer with private things to having the ability to watch the entire room. </p>
            <p>The camera has many features, including able to live stream for anyone not in the house but wants to check on their security. This service that the camera gives allows to check on the family or pets. This camera can also record as much as the user wants depending on the amount of storage. This can allow for helping police with any evidence or to be able to get insurance benefits. The camera can also send mails to the user if there was an object that it detected moving. This can be used to see if there was a place visited which is important for the user. The camera will require a plug to run so it cannot be placed everywhere, but this for if the detection and email is required for the user. If not, the camera can be temporarily powered by a power bank. The camera can also have a housing made by the user or Raspberry Pi casing to now have wires all over the place. The camera can be placed anywhere when the user leaves the home and get the camera to power when the user comes back home. </p>
            <p>The tools required to make the security includes Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless, Raspberry Pi camera module, Adafruit Raspberry Pi zero camera cable and micro-USB to USB cable. Another could be needed like the casing depending on what type including one that is flat like the official Raspberry Pi Zero case or I could make one that is more shaped like a cube that can be put anywhere from the use of a thick board with holes for the wires. This means there will be drill machines required to make the holy for the wires and the screws. The camera can also be used in the dark or nighttime but will require a different camera. The software required for Raspberry Pi includes open CV to be installed and the use of Github. There will be the use two emails required if the project fully finishes which includes one made for the camera to email from and one that is to email to someone, which will allow the detection system to work. </p>
            <p>The skill required to make this project and finish it is some good knowledge on how to use Raspberry Pi and how to code in Github. There also some experience needed in open CV which can code the camera. Github will allow for more coding to be done on the camera, including entering the mailing function and detection to work. There is also some knowledge needed in Raspberry Pi and the use of the camera and other equipment as these need activation and tests to be done on them before they are used. The skill required can be quite difficult to find as no ordinary Github guide will give instructions on how to code the amount needed for the camera. There are some videos that can help with coding for the camera websites to help further but to gain the skill can be hard. </p>
            <p>If the project is successful, then all the features that were listed will be able to work with no faults. If the project is not successful, then features like being able to save the content or detect objects can be the failure. If any problems rise, I will try go to the websites or videos that help with the use of Raspberry Pi technology. The original problem will be solved by being able to use the camera with use of a phone or laptop and to be able to see the safety of the user’s house. This will allow for more people to look at their safety of the home through a phone which might reduce theft rates in the neighborhood we live in. </p>
